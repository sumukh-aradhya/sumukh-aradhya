Iâ€™ve previously worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer**, building and integrating Generative AI-powered product components using tools like **Python**, **React**, **Computer Vision and Large Language Models**, and more. Iâ€™ve contributed to both **fast-paced startups** and **innovation-driven teams at large companies**, helping build novel, high-impact AI solutions.

Currently I'm strengthening my fundamental knowledge at **San Jose State University** by pursuing a **Masterâ€™s in Computer Science**.

Ex-ML Engineer @ Inhabitr | Software Engineer @ Zebra Technologies

**Interests:** Generative AI, LLMs, ML Systems, Full-Stack development


ðŸ§ª**Current Research:** Enhancing code review automation using enhancements on Quantized 'Dynamic' Low-Rank Adaptation (QDyLoRA) fine-tuning with Llama 3 and integrating a RAG pipeline for better inference, focusing on performance-efficient open-source solutions. Goal is to reduce memory utilization during fine-tuning while making sure inference quality is not compromised.
